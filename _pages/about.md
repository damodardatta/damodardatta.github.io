Hello, I'm Damodar Datta Kancharla and currently studying M.Sc in Complex Adaptive systems at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/).

Unit recently, i used to work at [RRC](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/) as a Research Assistant, advised by [Dr.Harikumar Kandath](https://sites.google.com/view/harikumar-kandath/home) . Here worked on using drones [to survey civil structures](https://github.com/UVRSABI), using inside confined spaces and using DL techniques for state estimation and control.

Apart from Research, i'm otaku and F1 Tifosi üèéÔ∏è. I'm always open for discussion in F1 racing, anime,
cooking and movies.
