Hello, I'm Damodar Datta Kancharla and currently studying M.Sc in Complex Adaptive systems at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/). At present i'm doing my masters thesis at [Fraunhofer IPM](https://www.ipm.fraunhofer.de/en.html) about monocular camera based 3D reconstruction of railway infrastructure.

Until recently, i used to work as a research assistant at Robot Athletic Intelligence Lab at Chalmers. Before that, i was working at [RRC](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/) as a Research Assistant, advised by [Dr.Harikumar Kandath](https://sites.google.com/view/harikumar-kandath/home) on using drones [to survey civil structures](https://github.com/UVRSABI), using inside confined spaces and using DL techniques for state estimation and control.

Apart from Research, i like travelling and cooking . I'm always open for discussion in F1 racing, anime, cuisines and movies.
