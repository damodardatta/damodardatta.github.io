Hello, I'm Damodar Datta Kancharla and work at [RRC](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/) as a Research Assistant, advised by [Dr.Harikumar Kandath](https://sites.google.com/view/harikumar-kandath/home) . Here worked on using drones [to survey civil structures](https://github.com/UVRSABI), using inside confined spaces and using DL techniques for state estimation and control.

Until recently, i used to work as Assistant Manager in [Hero MotoCorp Ltd](https://www.heromotocorp.com/en-in.html). During my time at Hero MotoCorp, I had the pleasure of working in the Maintenance Dept (India 1st manufacturing plant with Industry 4.0 for ultilities and maintenace) for the machines of Weld shop and Paint shop.

Apart from Research, i'm otaku üëΩ and F1 Tifosi üèéÔ∏è. I'm always open for discussion in F1 racing, anime,
cooking and movies.
