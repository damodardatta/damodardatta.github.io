# Short Bio

Hi, I am Damodar Datta Kancharla . I'm a research assistant in [Robotics Research Center, IIIT-H][rrc]. At [I hub ,IIIT-H][Ihub], i'm working on the project of drone based 'Identification of Salient Structural Elements of a Buildings' . I have completed B.Tech in Mechatronics Engineering from [SRM institute of Science and Technology][srm],Chennai, India in 2020.

# Current Research & Projects

- State Estimation using UWB
- Drone based Identification of Salient Features of a Buildings
- CBF based MPC for UAVs inside a Tunnel
